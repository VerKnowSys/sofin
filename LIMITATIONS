Early version of "sofin" implies some limitations:

1. only one level of dependency among definitions (flat dependencies)
2. only "tar.gz" archives files are cached
3. only gzip format of source/packages is supported. In case of using different format it wont be recognized and failure will happen.
4. missing sha/md5 checking or any checking of validity of downloaded software packages
