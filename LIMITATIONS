Early version of SvdOpt implies some limitations:

1. only one level of dependency among definitions
2. only tar.gz files are cached
3. only gzip format of source/package is supported. In case of using different format it wont be recognized and failure will happen.
4. missing md5 checking or any checking of validity of downloaded software packages
