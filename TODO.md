## TODO list (in order of importance):
* Make it easier to install Sofin on non svdOS systems.
* Add full support for OpenBSD, NetBSD and DragonflyBSD.
* Add alternative for /Software and /Services on new Darwin systems (11+) which also have / in read only mode.
* Add ability to list available binary bundles (from http://software.verknowsys.com/binary/)
* Add better support for BIGlittle arm64, to prioritize using faster CPU cores for serial tasks.
