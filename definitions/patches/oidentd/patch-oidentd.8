-When IP masquerading support is enabled, forward requests for machines that masquerade through us to those machines on the specified port. If a port is not given, oidentd will use the default port for the ident service ("auth" or port 113). If the forwarded request fails, \fBoidentd\fP will fall back to reading the \fB/etc/oidentd_masq.conf\fP file. In order for forwarding to work, the machine to which the connection is forwarded must also be running oidentd, and oidentd must be run with the -P switch specifying the host that is forwarding the connections. If the ident daemon on the host to which the connection is forwarded is capable of returning a fixed string for any lookup (for example, the ident server built in to the mIRC windows IRC client), it is not necessary to run oidentd on that host.
